# Hello Android

This is my repository for the Hello Android Assignment for INFO 448.

This project can be built using gradle. Source code for building the android application is in the hello directory.

Screenshots of the application running using an emulator can be found in the screenshots directory. A video can also be found showing the application running on an Android device.
